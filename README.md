The primary objective of this project is to analyze global population trends from 2000 to 2024 and provide a comprehensive, interactive visualization using Power BI. 
👉 Monitor population growth patterns at global, regional, and country levels.

👉Understand the impact of key factors such as migration, urbanization, fertility rates, and density on population dynamics.

👉Make data-driven decisions for future population forecasting, resource allocation, and policymaking.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬

𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐨𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡:
The world's population increased significantly from 6.14 billion in 2000 to 8.05 billion in 2024, marking an average yearly growth rate of 1.05%.

𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

👉 China and India lead the population statistics, together accounting for over 35% of the global population.

👉India is projected to surpass China in population by 2024, driven by higher fertility rates.


𝐔𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬:

👉The percentage of the global population living in urban areas grew from 47% in 2000 to 56% in 2024, reflecting rapid urbanization in developing nations.

👉Regions like Africa and Asia show the highest urbanization growth rates.

𝐌𝐢𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬:

👉Developed countries experienced positive net migration, contributing significantly to population growth in regions like Europe and North America.

👉In contrast, some developing countries faced negative migration trends due to economic and political instability.

𝐅𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞:

👉Countries with lower fertility rates, such as Japan and Germany, exhibit aging populations and declining growth.

👉Higher fertility rates in Africa lead to younger populations but pose challenges for infrastructure and resource management.

𝐏𝐨𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲:
Small nations like Singapore and Monaco have the highest population densities, while countries like Canada and Australia remain sparsely populated.



𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬

𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐚𝐩𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬:
Implemented forecasting models in Power BI to predict population trends for the next ten years (2025–2035), offering actionable insights for policymakers.

"India has secured the top rank globally in terms of population."
